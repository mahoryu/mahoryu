### Ethan Holden 🍳

Hi, I'm Ethan. I am a Lambda School Data Science graduate and 
I am passionate about using technology to both make things more efficient and
to find and make conclusions that would otherwise be much harder to find.

Some things to know about me:
- 🛰 Languages include: Python, C++, and Visual Basic (specifically for Excel).
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: an Asteroid game to refresh my OOP Python skills.
- 🥧 Fun fact: Not only am I into code and all it can do, but I am also a certified culinarian with a passion for food.
